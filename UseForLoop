//I have been practicing how to use for loops in C#. Before starting, I gained basic knowledge about for loops by watching videos on YouTube. I found the concept to be fairly straightforward. I learned how to use for loops, but I wasn't sure where to practice them effectively.

//To improve, I decided to search for good practice platforms and eventually found websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and others. I started solving problems there, which helped me a lot in understanding for loops better and using them in different scenarios.



//Some easy task i solved in leetcode where use for loop functions to solve:_Question(1497)Check if array pairs are divisible by k:

//Besides learning about loops, I have also learned other concepts like arrays, using Console.WriteLine for output, the Length property for arrays, and much more.
